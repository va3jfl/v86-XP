This web-based system is created and maintained by Joel Lagace. It is built upon a heavily modified and extended implementation of the open-source v86 / x86-box emulator project.

Significant modifications include (but are not limited to):

    Custom user interface and control frontend
    Custom system configuration and runtime layout
    Pre-initialized operating system environments
    State-based boot, snapshot save/load, and restoration logic
    Self-hosted deployment and optimized compressed state delivery

This project demonstrates browser-based x86 emulation and snapshot-based system restoration for research, educational, archival, and experimental purposes.
